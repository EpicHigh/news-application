# News Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the News Application! This is your ultimate source for the latest news updates. Powered by Vue.js, our application offers a robust, fast, and interactive user experience. Stay connected with the world and keep yourself updated with our continually refreshed news content from diverse sources.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the installation, please ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. Node.js: Our application requires Node.js to run. If you don't have it installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. pnpm: We use the pnpm package manager for managing our dependencies. If not already installed, you can install it globally by running `npm install -g pnpm`.
